# Repo Lookout: Find publicly exposed source code repositories

*Repo Lookout* is a large-scale security scanner, with a single purpose: **Find source code repositories that
have been inadvertently exposed to the public** and report them to the domainâ€™s technical contact.

Accidentally exposed source code repositories often contain highly sensitive information that can be used for
downstream attacks, such as data leakage and ransomware extortion. While the problem has been known and
extensively documented for years, our findings show that it is still prevalent.

Our goal is to combat this vulnerability by automatically detecting and reporting instances.
